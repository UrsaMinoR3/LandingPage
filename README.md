<h1>FIRST PROJECT OF THE ODIN LEARNING PATH</h1>

On this opportunity i get to work very closely with HTML and CSS. I had to use every resource that i learned in the project and i ad to google for some others to complete this challange.

On the structure of this project i had to be very careful with the tags to use, everything goes according to the good practices in front-end development. 

<h1>FOR THE PEOPLE WATCHING THE PROJECT ONLINE</h1>

Hope you can inspect the code in google or any browser your seen it and you can give me feedback trough this repository, everything will be taken as an opportunity to learn and keep growing.

<h1>IMPORTANT</h1>

Some features of this project , like responsiveness or flowing are not going to work as expected due that the main goal of the project was to take a given layout and try to replicate it.
